# Monocle
Monocle is a fast, efficient and thread-safe unique id generator written in Go. Choose the timestamp resolution and the length of the random string to suit your specific requirements.

## Sortable
The generated values are constructed so that they are always in chronological order when sorted alphabetically.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/dsincl12/monocle
```

## Usage example

```go
import "github.com/dsincl12/monocle"

func main() {
    // create instance with configuration
    m := monocle.New(monocle.Config{
        TimestampResolution:      time.Millisecond,
        NumberOfRandomCharacters: 8,
    })
    
    // generate value
    value := m.Next() // => RSMJ6sUpQxNE1eN

    // parse timestamp from value
    timestamp := m.ParseTimestamp(value) // => 2019-06-03 18:48:34.13 +0000 UTC
    
    // parse random string from value
    randomString := m.ParseRandomString(value) // => pQxNE1eN
}
```
